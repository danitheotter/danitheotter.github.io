        <h1>Day in the life of Aleeks Vader</h1>
        <h3 class = "section-title">Because I'm just so cool</h3>
        </div>

        <p>I live a very interesting life, so clearly everyone wants to know about it. I mean, 5 people follow my Tiktok, so I'm basically internet famous and you all definitely want to read about my day. Also no, I won't talk about school, becuase who really cares about school? Like for part 2 where I talk about my skincare routine :))))</p>

        <div id = "morning" class = "box">
        <h2 class = "section-title">Morning</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, I wake up at 3 AM. That seems pretty obvious</li>
            <li>Next, I get out of bed and get dressed. I always dress my best so I can slay the day away</li>
            <li>After getting dressed, I eat a nutricious breakfast of cough drops with a side of water</li>
            <li>I then tie up my hair into a messy bun. I am not like other girls</li>
            <li>After all that useless garbage, I watch cat videos for the next 5 hours</li>
            <li>Finally, I go to school 5 minutes late. Its worth it for the cats</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div id = "afternoon" class = "box">
        <h2 class = "section-title">Afternoon</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>After I get home from a busy day of bullying Danoelle and doing compsci work instead of any of my other classes, I sit down for my second 5 hour session of cat videos</li>
            <li>Eventually, I have to be dragged from my screen by my mother to go to <span id = "piano-lessons">PIANO LESSONS</span> (ew) and practice my stupid piano >:(</li>
            <li>I really hate piano for about 2 minutes and then I ditch because screw you mom</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div id = "night" class = "box">
        <h2 class = "section-title">Night</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Once I'm done working very hard at my piano, I have to go home, unfortunately, and watch my father losing at COD against 14 year olds.</li>
            <li>Then, I think about doing my homework, but decide that I can do it in the morning, and by the morning I mean in the class I have directly before it</li>
            <li>I eat about one bite of the meal lovingly cooked by my mother, but cough drops are clearly better so I eat those instead</li>
            <lI>Finally, after my meal, I watch cat videos until I pass out from exhaustion</lI>
        </ol>
        </div>
